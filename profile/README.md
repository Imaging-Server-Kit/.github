# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome!

The **Imaging Server Kit** is an initiative started by the [EPFL Center for Imaging](https://imaging.epfl.ch/) to develop a simple framework for creating and using interoperable image processing algorithms via a client/server system.

The *kit* includes:

- A **collection of algorithms** that can be deployed as web servers (with or without [Docker](https://github.com/Imaging-Server-Kit/serverkit-deploy-docker)) and run from [QuPath](https://github.com/Imaging-Server-Kit/qupath-extension-serverkit) or [Napari](https://github.com/Imaging-Server-Kit/napari-serverkit), for a wide range of tasks:
 
| Task              | Examples                        | Napari | QuPath |
|-------------------|---------------------------------| ------ | ------ |

- A [Template](https://github.com/Imaging-Server-Kit/cookiecutter-serverkit) to easily create new image processing algorithm servers.


The *Imaging Server Kit* is designed for:

- **Algorithm developers**: Test your tools in QuPath or Napari without having to create extensions or plugins.
- **Non-technical Users**: Use Python projects without needing to set them up on your computer.

### Key Features

- **Server/Client**: Run algorithms on a server that you connect to from client apps (Napari, QuPath).
- **Auto-generated UI** for algorithm parameters in QuPath and Napari. No need for separate extensions or plugins!
- **Interoperable Algorithms** that all accept inputs and express outputs in the same way.
- **Dockerized**: Build or pull a Docker image, then start/stop a container to use an algorithm.

## Roadmap

**March 2025**

The *Imaging Server Kit* is under construction! Here is what we're up to:

- [X] Make the `/info` route look nice
- [ ] Screencast a tutorial on how to create a new algorithm server
- [ ] Add a server-side timeout to the `/process` endpoint
- [ ] Improve the AuthenticatedServer
- [ ] Handle streaming/tiling for processing whole-slide images
- [ ] Add a sample image button in the QuPath extension
- [ ] QuPath extension can send annotations as algo inputs
- [ ] Make a Fiji plugin
