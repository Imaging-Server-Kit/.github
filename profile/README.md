# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome!

The **Imaging Server Kit** is an initiative started by the [EPFL Center for Imaging](https://imaging.epfl.ch/) to develop a simple framework for creating and using interoperable image processing algorithms via a client/server system.

The *kit* includes:

- A **collection of algorithms** that can be deployed as web servers (with or without [Docker](https://github.com/Imaging-Server-Kit/serverkit-deploy-docker)) and run from [QuPath](https://github.com/Imaging-Server-Kit/qupath-extension-serverkit) or [Napari](https://github.com/Imaging-Server-Kit/napari-serverkit), for a wide range of tasks:
 
| Task              | Examples                        |
|-------------------|---------------------------------|
| Segmentation     | [StarDist](https://github.com/Imaging-Server-Kit/serverkit-stardist), [CellPose](https://github.com/Imaging-Server-Kit/serverkit-cellpose), [Rembg](https://github.com/Imaging-Server-Kit/serverkit-rembg), [SAM-2](https://github.com/Imaging-Server-Kit/serverkit-sam2), [InstanSeg](https://github.com/Imaging-Server-Kit/serverkit-instanseg)               |
| Object detection | [Spotiflow](https://github.com/Imaging-Server-Kit/serverkit-spotiflow), [LoG detector](https://github.com/Imaging-Server-Kit/serverkit-skimage-LoG)    |
| Object tracking  | [Trackastra](https://github.com/Imaging-Server-Kit/serverkit-trackastra), [Trackpy](https://github.com/Imaging-Server-Kit/serverkit-trackpy)         |
| Vector fields   | [Orientationpy](https://github.com/Imaging-Server-Kit/serverkit-orientationpy)                   |
| Image-to-Image  | [SPAM](https://github.com/Imaging-Server-Kit/serverkit-spam), [Noise2Void](https://github.com/Imaging-Server-Kit/serverkit-n2v)         |
| Text-to-Image   | [Stable Diffusion](https://github.com/Imaging-Server-Kit/serverkit-stable-diffusion)         |
| Image-to-Text   | [Image captioning](https://github.com/Imaging-Server-Kit/serverkit-blip-captioning)         |
| Classification   | [ResNet50](https://github.com/Imaging-Server-Kit/serverkit-resnet50)         |

- A [Template](https://github.com/Imaging-Server-Kit/cookiecutter-serverkit) to easily create new image processing algorithm servers.


The *Imaging Server Kit* is designed for:

- **Algorithm developers**: Test your tools in QuPath or Napari without having to create extensions or plugins.
- **Non-technical Users**: Use Python projects without needing to set them up on your computer.

### Key Benefits

- **Interoperable Algorithms**: Easily compare algorithm outputs or integrate multiple algorithms to build complex workflows.
- **Generated Interfaces**: Automatically generate UIs for algorithm parameters in QuPath and Napari. No need for separate extensions or plugins!
- **Processing on a Server**: Run algorithms on a powerful workstation or server (e.g., with GPU) and connect to them via client apps on a laptop.
- **Easy Deployment**: Pull a Docker image, then simply start/stop a container to use an algorithm.

## Roadmap

**February 2025**

The *Imaging Server Kit* is under construction! Here is what we're up to:

- [x] Add styling to the algorithm `/info` page
- [X] Add a `class` output type to support image classifiers
- [X] Add a `text` input/output type to support diffusion models and LLMs
- [ ] Screencast a tutorial on how to create a new algorithm server
- [ ] Add a server-side timeout to the `/process` endpoint
- [ ] Handle tiling and optimize for running on whole-slide images
- [ ] Add a sample image button in the QuPath extension
- [ ] QuPath extension can send annotations as algo inputs
- [ ] Make a Fiji plugin
